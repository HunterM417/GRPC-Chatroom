# Distributed Objects Programming : Spring 2019 - Final Iteration
Programming Assignments for Radu Stoleru's Spring 2019 Distributed Objects Programming (Distributed Systems) course.

This project was built using C++ and the google remote procedure call (gRPC) library.  It implements a simple chatroom interface in the command line.  It was built iteratively over the year, starting from a simple message sender, and eventually becoming an implementation of a highly distributed and highly reliable message sending system.
